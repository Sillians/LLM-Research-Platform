# **Inference Systems in LLMs**

An **inference system** enables efficient and high-quality execution of Large Language Models (LLMs). It combines request handling, execution management, and memory management, either for **generic workloads** or **specialized applications**.


### **1. Components of an Inference System**

* **Frontend**

  * Provides **user interaction** with the LLM.
  * Interfaces:

    * **Declarative**: users specify *what* they want (e.g., structured queries).
    * **Imperative**: users specify *how* to interact (e.g., procedural API calls).
  * May include:

    * **Structured outputs** (e.g., JSON-formatted responses).
    * **Automatic prompt optimization** to improve response quality.

* **Runtime**

  * Manages **execution and system resources**.
  * Two main runtime categories:

    1. **Single-replica runtimes**

       * Handle requests on **one LLM instance**.
       * Focus on efficient request scheduling and memory usage.
    2. **Multi-replica runtimes**

       * Handle environments with **multiple identical LLMs**.
       * Support **scalability** and **parallel processing**.



### **2. Execution Modes**

* **Distributed execution**

  * Both single- and multi-replica runtimes can spread computation across multiple nodes/GPUs.
  * Increases throughput and reduces latency.

* **Disaggregated execution** (specific to multi-replica systems)

  * Decouples components (e.g., separating memory from compute).
  * Provides flexibility and efficiency in large-scale deployments.



**In summary**:
An LLM inference system has a **frontend** (interfaces + optimizations) and a **runtime** (execution management). Single-replica runtimes optimize a single model instance, while multi-replica runtimes enable scalability and can support **distributed** and **disaggregated** execution.
