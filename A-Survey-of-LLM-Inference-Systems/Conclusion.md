# **7. Conclusion**

The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications has created an urgent need for **specialized high-performance inference systems**. Unlike conventional deep learning workloads, LLM inference presents unique challenges due to the **autoregressive generation process**, which introduces substantial cost variability and unpredictable request lifecycles. As a result, the design of efficient inference systems has become a critical research frontier.

This survey organized the landscape of LLM inference into a **unified framework** consisting of three core dimensions: **request processing**, **model execution**, and **memory management**. Within this framework, we highlighted key innovations such as continuous batching, chunked prefills, managed cache persistence, multi-level scheduling, paged attention, and quantization-aware memory hierarchies. Collectively, these advances enable inference systems to achieve higher throughput, lower latency, and more efficient use of limited hardware resources while maintaining output quality.

A recurring theme across recent systems is the importance of **adaptivity**. To cope with the inherent uncertainty of autoregressive generation, inference runtimes increasingly rely on **load prediction**, **dynamic batch sizing**, **elastic resource provisioning**, and **asynchronous memory offloading**. These techniques reflect a broader shift from static, monolithic designs towards **elastic, disaggregated, and serverless architectures** that can scale resources with fine granularity and adapt to workload fluctuations. Disaggregated systems, in particular, demonstrate that decoupling prefill and decode phases offers greater flexibility and more precise resource management without sacrificing performance.

Looking forward, future progress in LLM inference will likely involve a convergence of techniques. Widely adopted methods such as continuous batching and paged attention are already becoming de facto standards, while emerging approaches—including multi-level scheduling, asynchronous recovery across tiered storage, and hot-entry replication—are poised to play a central role in next-generation runtimes. At the same time, **quantization strategies**, **profile switching**, and **multi-modal LLM support** open up new design challenges that demand more systematic investigation.

Ultimately, the evolution of inference systems will require balancing **efficiency**, **adaptivity**, and **scalability**. By integrating innovations across request scheduling, model execution, and memory management, LLM inference systems are progressing towards architectures that can robustly sustain the growing scale and complexity of LLM-driven applications.

### **1. Motivation**

* **LLM adoption = rapid & widespread.**
* Workloads = **high-velocity + high-volume**, beyond what generic DL serving systems can handle.
* **Autoregressive nature** (token-by-token generation) makes LLM inference fundamentally different, requiring new system techniques.



### **2. Unified Framework**

* The survey organizes innovations into **three pillars**:

  1. **Request Processing** → scheduling, batching, prioritization.
  2. **Model Execution** → optimized kernels, operator design, scaling strategies.
  3. **Memory Management** → caching, quantization, eviction/offloading strategies.

This unification provides a lens to compare/extend existing inference systems.



### **3. Design Principles**

* **Cost Uncertainty of Autoregression:**

  * Sequence length is unpredictable.
  * Memory and compute costs vary across requests.
* **Core responses:**

  * **Load prediction** → to anticipate resource demand.
  * **Adaptive designs** → dynamic batching, elastic scaling.
  * **Cost reduction** → quantization, memory tiering, paged attention.



### **4. System Architectures**

* Innovations culminate in **single-replica** and **multi-replica** systems.
* **Multi-replica disaggregated systems**:

  * Prefill and decode separated into different workers.
  * Allow **finer-grained resource management**.
  * Improve scalability, elasticity, and workload balancing.


**Final Takeaway:**
LLM inference systems are evolving into **specialized, adaptive, and elastic infrastructures**. The convergence of request scheduling, efficient model execution, and advanced memory management will define the next generation of inference runtimes, ensuring **high throughput, low latency, and scalable resource utilization** in the face of unpredictable LLM workloads.
