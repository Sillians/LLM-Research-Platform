# **BUILD VS. BUY PRE-TRAINED LLM MODELS**

Before diving into pre-training an LLM, you first need to decide whether you should train from scratch or adopt an existing model. Below are three general approaches — updated with the more recent models and architectures in the field — along with their tradeoffs and when they make sense.


### Approaches

#### **Option 1: Use a commercial LLM via API**
  
  Examples include GPT-4.1 / GPT-4.5 (OpenAI), Claude Opus / Claude 4 (Anthropic), Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) — powerful, fully hosted models. These give you high performance, managed infrastructure, and fast iteration. Downsides: recurring API costs, limited control over internals, potential latency or rate limits, and dependency on third-party availability.


Examples: **GPT-4.5 (OpenAI), Claude 4 Opus (Anthropic), Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google).**

**Pros**

* Requires the least LLM training technical skills.
* Minimum upfront training or exploration cost since the main expense occurs at inference.
* The least data-demanding option — few or no examples are needed for inference.
* Access to the best-performing LLMs in the market, enabling superior user experiences.
* Reduces time-to-market and de-risks projects with a working LLM from the start.



**Cons**

* Can become expensive at scale with high inference or fine-tuning usage — total cost of ownership (TCO) grows quickly.
* Many industries (e.g., healthcare, finance) restrict sending sensitive or PII data to external providers, limiting applicability.
* Heavy reliance on external APIs introduces vendor lock-in risk; if building external apps, business moats must come from elsewhere.
* Limited flexibility downstream: fine-tuning is costly, edge deployment is not supported, and ongoing model improvements are outside your control.


**WHEN TO CONSIDER**

* Best if you have less technical teams but want to leverage LLM techniques to build downstream apps, or if you want best-in-class LLM performance without managing the infrastructure.
* A strong choice if you have very limited training datasets and need to rely on zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities.
* Ideal for prototyping apps quickly and exploring what’s possible with LLMs before committing to heavier investments.



#### **Option 2: Use an existing open-source / open-weight LLM**
  
  Some of the more recent and notable ones include:

  * **GPT-oss** (OpenAI’s open-weight models, e.g. 120B / 20B) — gives you the ability to deploy and fine-tune locally or in your infrastructure. 
  * **LLaMA 4** (Scout / Maverick) — Meta’s more recent multimodal models, intended to be open source.
  * **Qwen 3** from Alibaba — hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with large context windows.
  * **DeepSeek R1 / DeepSeek V3 / DeepSeek V-series** — reasoning-oriented MoE models with strong performance in logic/math tasks.
  * **Mistral Medium 3 / Magistral Small & Medium** — more efficient reasoning models in Mistral’s lineup.
  * **BitNet b1.58 2B4T** — a native 1-bit open model (2B scale) optimized for memory and compute efficiency.
  * **LLM360 K2 (65B)** — an open-source “360” project building a large LLM with transparent practices and documentation.

  These open / open-weight choices allow you to fine-tune, adapt, inspect, and self-host. However, you still need infrastructure, optimization expertise, and you may face integration & scaling challenges.


Examples: **LLaMA 4 (Meta), Mistral Medium 3, DeepSeek V3 / R1, Qwen 3 (Alibaba), BitNet b1.58 (Microsoft Research), LLM360 K2.**

**Pros**

* Leverage what LLMs have learned from vast internet-scale data without paying per-inference IP costs.
* Compared to Option 1, less dependent on the roadmap of commercial providers, giving more control and flexibility.
* Faster time-to-value than pre-training from scratch; requires less data, training time, and budget.
* Transparency and flexibility to fine-tune or adapt models for specific domains or tasks.



**Cons**

* Requires domain expertise to fine-tune, optimize, and host effectively; reproducibility is still a major challenge.
* Slower time-to-market compared to commercial APIs due to managing a more complex vertical stack.
* Open-source models often lag performance relative to the best commercial models by months or even years; competitors using cutting-edge APIs may gain an advantage.


**WHEN TO CONSIDER**

* If you aren’t changing the model architecture, it’s almost always better to fine-tune an existing pre-trained LLM or continue pre-training from existing weights rather than starting from scratch. These models have already learned broad general-purpose capabilities from massive datasets.
* Suitable if your training dataset is not huge or diverse, since you can leverage the model’s existing knowledge.
* Typical in regulatory environments or where sensitive user data cannot be sent to external API providers.
* Also a good choice when edge deployment is required for latency, cost, or location-specific reasons.



#### **Option 3: Pre-train an LLM yourself or via consultants / platforms**
  This gives you maximum control over architecture, data, training regime, and deployment constraints. It’s the most resource-intensive and technically demanding. Use this route only if:

  1. You have access to massive, unique, high-quality data
  2. You require custom architecture, features, or domain specialization not supported by existing models
  3. You want full ownership, auditability, and flexibility over the entire stack

  Many organizations instead use consultancies, managed LLM platforms, or hybrid approaches (e.g. starting from an open-weight checkpoint and continuing training).


**Pros**

* Maximum control over the LLM’s performance, architecture, and future direction, allowing deep customization.
* Full control of the pre-training dataset, which directly impacts model quality, bias, and safety — unlike with Options 1 and 2.
* Builds a strong competitive moat: superior LLM performance for general or domain-specific tasks, reinforced by positive feedback loops from deployments.
* Flexibility to innovate on techniques and adapt the model to highly specialized downstream needs.




**Cons**

* Extremely expensive and high-risk; requires cross-domain expertise in ML, hardware optimization, and data engineering. Errors late in training are costly and often irreversible.
* Risk of spending millions with results worse than open alternatives if execution is suboptimal.
* Less efficient than adapting existing LLMs: starting from scratch requires enormous amounts of high-quality, diverse datasets to achieve generalization, whereas Option 2 leverages years of accumulated internet-scale pretraining.



**WHEN TO CONSIDER**

* Best if you need to alter fundamental aspects of the model such as tokenizer design, vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, attention heads, or number of layers.
* Typically pursued when the LLM is central to your business strategy and competitive moat, and you are willing to innovate on training techniques with a large appetite for ongoing investment.
* Makes sense if you have large amounts of proprietary data and can establish a continuous improvement loop that compounds over time, creating a sustainable long-term advantage.





### Pros, Cons & Applicability (with modern context)

| Approach                                 | Pros                                                                        | Cons / Risks                                                               | When It Makes Sense                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commercial API (Option 1)**            | Best quality out-of-the-box, no infrastructure required, fast time-to-value | Cost accumulates, limited transparency/control, dependency                 | For prototypes, small teams, or when model internals are not critical     |
| **Open / open-weight models (Option 2)** | Control, transparency, flexibility, no API lock-in                          | Requires infrastructure, optimization, sometimes legal/license constraints | When you need customization, privacy, or local deployment                 |
| **Training from scratch (Option 3)**     | Total control over architecture, data and model behavior                    | Extremely expensive (compute, talent, engineering), risk of failure        | Only for organizations with scale, unique data, or deep ML research goals |



### **Takeaway**

* **Option 1** optimizes for speed and performance but sacrifices flexibility and cost control.
* **Option 2** strikes a middle ground, providing more control and transparency but requiring technical maturity and acceptance of a performance gap.
* **Option 3** maximizes control and ownership but is resource-intensive and risky, suitable only for organizations with the scale and expertise to absorb the cost.




### Recommendation

For most teams in 2025, an **open-weight or open-source model** offers the best balance: you avoid vendor lock-in and gain control, while leveraging state-of-the-art models rather than reinventing core capabilities. Only shift to full pre-training when there is no suitable published model, or when your requirements (data, performance, architecture) are far outside what existing models can satisfy.

It is also worth mentioning that if you only have a very targeted set of use cases and don’t need the general-purpose capabilities or
generative capabilities from LLMs, you might want to consider training or fine-tuning a much smaller transformer or other much simpler
deep learning models. That could result in much less complexity, less training time, and less ongoing costs.
