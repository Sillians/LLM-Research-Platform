# **Pre-Training Steps in LLM Development**

Training a **multi-billion parameter LLM** is not a straightforward scaling exercise but an **iterative, experimental process**. Researchers typically:

1. Begin with **smaller baseline models** to test stability.
2. Scale gradually, addressing new challenges that only appear at large scale (e.g., optimization stability, GPU memory constraints, throughput bottlenecks).



## **1. Model Architecture**

Most LLMs build on **well-established predecessors** like GPT-2 and GPT-3 to minimize risks. Adjustments are then introduced for efficiency, stability, or scalability.

### **Example 1: GPT-NeoX-20B (EleutherAI, 20B params)**

Derived from GPT-3 but with several innovations:

* **Rotary embeddings (RoPE):**

  * Used for **25% of embedding dimensions** instead of learned positional embeddings.
  * Balance between computational efficiency and positional information quality.

* **Parallel attention + feedforward:**

  * Instead of stacking them **sequentially** (as in GPT-3), they run in **parallel**.
  * Reduces compute time while maintaining performance.

* **Dense layers only (no sparse):**

  * GPT-3 alternates **dense and sparse layers** for efficiency.
  * GPT-NeoX simplifies by keeping **all dense layers**, reducing complexity in implementation and debugging.



### **Example 2: OPT-175B (Meta AI, 175B params)**

A direct GPT-3 alternative with notable training strategy adjustments:

* **Batch size tuning:**

  * Larger, more efficient batch sizes for GPU throughput optimization.

* **Learning rate (LR) schedule:**

  * **Linear warmup**: Gradual ramp-up from 0 → max LR over first **2000 steps** (or 375M tokens for smaller variants).
  * **Decay**: LR decays to **10% of max** over **300B tokens**.
  * Includes **mid-flight LR adjustments** to stabilize training (often necessary at scale).

* **Token budget:**

  * OPT-175B trained on **180B tokens**, significantly less than GPT-3’s **300B tokens**.
  * Despite same parameter size, the **smaller dataset size** reflects trade-offs between cost and performance.



## **2. Key Takeaways from Scaling Up**

* **Baseline reuse is critical** → starting from known architectures (GPT family) reduces risks.
* **Efficiency-driven modifications** (parallelization, embedding tweaks, scheduling tricks) are often more impactful than exotic architectures.
* **Training dataset size vs. model size trade-offs**:

  * More tokens usually improve generalization.
  * But compute and memory constraints often force compromises (e.g., OPT-175B).
* **Hyperparameter scaling laws**: batch size, LR schedules, and embedding dimensions require **non-linear tuning** as models grow.

## **Optimization & Training Stability in LLM Pre-Training**

After choosing an architecture, the next challenge is **efficient and stable optimization**. Training instability is one of the biggest risks in large-scale LLMs, since even minor divergences can waste **millions of GPU-hours**.



### **1. Optimizers**

Most LLMs rely on **Adam variants**, which balance fast convergence with stability.

* **Adam / AdamW (weight decay version):**

  * Standard choice for GPT-family models.
  * AdamW decouples weight decay from gradient updates, leading to better generalization.

* **Shampoo, Adafactor, LAMB (less common at extreme scale):**

  * Designed for efficiency at very large batch sizes.
  * Adafactor (used in T5) reduces memory by factorizing second-order moment estimates.

**Takeaway:** AdamW remains the dominant optimizer, with modifications for scale.



### **2. Learning Rate (LR) Schedules**

The **LR schedule** is critical for both convergence and stability.

* **Warmup phase:**

  * Gradually ramp LR from **0 → target LR**.
  * Prevents divergence at the start when weights are randomly initialized.

* **Decay phase:**

  * Linear or cosine decay after warmup.
  * Prevents overshooting at late stages of training.

* **Examples:**

  * **GPT-3**: 375M token warmup, cosine decay.
  * **OPT**: Linear warmup (2000 steps) + linear decay to 10% of LR.



### **3. Gradient Scaling & Clipping**

* **Gradient clipping** (by norm) ensures no single gradient update destabilizes training.
* **Mixed-precision (FP16 or BF16)** requires **loss scaling** to prevent underflow in gradient values.

  * BF16 is preferred on newer GPUs (A100, H100) since it avoids explicit scaling and improves stability.



### **4. Regularization Techniques**

* **Dropout (less common at scale):**

  * Often avoided in very large models — implicit regularization from massive datasets is usually enough.

* **Weight decay:**

  * Standard, prevents overfitting and exploding weights.

* **Stochastic depth / layer dropping (research area):**

  * Some studies explore skipping layers probabilistically during training to stabilize very deep networks.



### **5. Checkpointing & Recovery**

Training can take **weeks to months** on thousands of GPUs, so stability measures include:

* **Periodic checkpointing** (every few hundred or thousand steps).
* **Resumable optimizers** (Adam states stored with precision).
* **Fault tolerance** via distributed systems (e.g., DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM).



### **6. Practical Stability Tricks Used in LLMs**

* **GPT-NeoX-20B:** Parallel attention+FFN to reduce bottlenecks.
* **PaLM (Google):** Optimized batch sizes + careful LR tuning.
* **Megatron-LM (NVIDIA):** FP16 + gradient accumulation + mixed parallelism.



### **Summary**

* **Optimizers:** AdamW (dominant), with memory-efficient variants like Adafactor in some models.
* **LR schedules:** Warmup → decay is crucial for stability.
* **Precision handling:** BF16 > FP16 due to robustness.
* **Gradient control:** Loss scaling + gradient clipping prevent instability.
* **Checkpointing:** Essential for recovery in multi-week training.

## **Experiments and Hyperparameter Search in LLM Pre-Training**

### 1. **Why Hyperparameter Search Matters**

* Large language models (LLMs) have **billions of parameters**, making performance highly sensitive to hyperparameter (HP) choices.
* Good HPs determine **stability, convergence, and efficiency**.
* Poor choices can lead to exploding/vanishing gradients, underfitting, or wasted compute.



### 2. **Types of Experiments**

* **Architecture-level**:

  * Weight initialization
  * Positional embeddings (absolute, rotary, ALiBi)
  * Number of layers, attention heads, hidden size, sequence length
  * Dense vs. sparse layers

* **Training-level**:

  * Optimizer choice (Adam, AdamW, Adafactor)
  * Activation functions (GELU, SwiGLU, ReLU)
  * Loss functions (cross-entropy, label smoothing, etc.)

* **Regularization**:

  * Dropout, weight decay, gradient clipping

* **Scaling**:

  * Batch size schedule
  * Learning rate schedule



### 3. **Manual vs. Automatic HPO**

* **Manual (trial-and-error)**: Guided by intuition, prior research, scaling laws.
* **Automatic (HPO frameworks)**:

  * Bayesian optimization
  * Random/grid search
  * Population-based training (PBT)
  * Hyperband / ASHA (efficient early stopping methods)

Typical **auto-searched hyperparameters**:

* Learning rate
* Batch size
* Dropout rate



### 4. **Scaling Considerations**

* **Full-scale HPO** (on 100B+ parameter models) is impractical due to cost.
* Instead:

  * Conduct experiments on **smaller models** (e.g., 125M, 1B parameters).
  * Use **scaling laws** to interpolate results for larger models.
  * Leverage insights from **published papers** to avoid reinventing.



### 5. **Dynamic Hyperparameters (Adjusted During Training)**

* **Learning rate**:

  * Warmup: small → larger LR in early steps (prevents instability).
  * Decay: cosine or exponential towards the end for convergence.

* **Batch size**:

  * Start small (reduces instability, better generalization).
  * Gradually increase as training stabilizes (efficient GPU utilization).



### 6. **Best Practices**

* **Do most HPO early**: cheaper with smaller datasets/models.
* **Keep logs & checkpoints**: helps avoid redoing failed experiments.
* **Expect failures**: divergence, instability, or unexpected slowdowns are common.
* **Mitigate cost**: use distributed training strategies (ZeRO, sharded optimizers), gradient accumulation, and adaptive schedulers.

## **Practical Workflow for Hyperparameter Search in LLM Pre-Training**

When tuning hyperparameters for LLMs, the workflow must balance **cost, scalability, and reliability**. Below is a structured pipeline:



### **1. Define the Search Space**

Choose which hyperparameters to tune and their ranges.

* **Learning Rate (LR):** `1e-5 → 1e-3` (log scale sampling)
* **Batch Size (tokens per GPU):** `512 → 16,384`
* **Dropout:** `0.0 → 0.3`
* **Weight Decay:** `0.0 → 0.1`
* **Warmup Steps:** `1k → 20k`
* **Optimizer Variants:** Adam, AdamW, Adafactor
* **Activation Functions:** GELU, SwiGLU, ReLU

For **exploratory runs**, keep the space wide. For **refinement**, narrow down ranges.



### **2. Start Small (Proxy Models & Datasets)**

* Train on **125M → 1B parameter models** instead of 50B+.
* Use a **subset of training data** (1–10%) for faster turnaround.
* Evaluate HP settings using proxy metrics (perplexity, loss trends, gradient stability).

This avoids burning millions in compute on bad configs.



### **3. Choose Optimization Method**

Different frameworks suit different goals:

| **Method**                          | **When to Use**                         | **Example Tools**                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Grid Search**                     | Small HP space, few params              | Scikit-learn, simple scripts      |
| **Random Search**                   | Large HP space, fast exploration        | Optuna, Ray Tune                  |
| **Bayesian Optimization**           | Expensive runs, continuous search space | Ax, Optuna                        |
| **Population-Based Training (PBT)** | Dynamic adaptation during training      | Ray Tune PBT                      |
| **ASHA / Hyperband**                | Early stopping to kill poor configs     | Ray Tune, Weights & Biases Sweeps |



### **4. Run Distributed HPO**

* Use distributed HPO frameworks to parallelize trials across GPUs/TPUs.
* Common setups:

  * **Ray Tune** + PyTorch Lightning / DeepSpeed
  * **Optuna** with pruning + multi-node training
  * **Weights & Biases Sweeps** for tracking

Parallelism ensures dozens of trials can run simultaneously across clusters.



### **5. Dynamic Schedules During Training**

* Implement **adaptive HP tuning**:

  * Increase **batch size** gradually.
  * Apply **cosine decay** for LR after warmup.
  * Adjust **dropout** as model scales.
* PBT automates these mid-training adjustments.



### **6. Evaluate and Scale**

* Rank configs by **validation perplexity / loss curve stability**.
* Pick top-performing HPs and **scale to larger models** using scaling laws.
* Example:

  * 1B model best LR = `3e-4` → For 20B, use `2–3e-4` with scaled batch size.



### **7. Logging and Experiment Tracking**

* Use experiment tracking tools:

  * **Weights & Biases (W&B)**
  * **MLflow**
  * **TensorBoard**
* Track: loss curves, gradient norms, activation stats, throughput.
* Store configs + results in a **search database** to avoid re-testing old setups.



### **8. Iterate**

* After scaling, repeat the search **narrowed around the best region**.
* Adjust based on observed instabilities (e.g., exploding loss, vanishing gradients).



### Key Takeaways

* Start with **small models + small data** to explore widely.
* Use **automatic HPO frameworks** with **early stopping** to save compute.
* Apply **scaling laws** to extrapolate results to large models.
* Always **log, analyze, and refine** before scaling up.

## **Challenges in Training LLMs – Hardware Failures & Training Instability**

### **1. Hardware Failure**

Training large language models is resource-intensive and typically involves massive compute clusters (hundreds to thousands of GPUs/TPUs). Failures are inevitable.

**Key Points:**

* **Failure Modes**: GPU crashes, node disconnections, memory leaks, overheating.
* **Recovery Approaches**:

  * **Manual restarts**: Pause training → run diagnostics → cordon off faulty nodes → resume from the last checkpoint.
  * **Automatic restarts**: Cluster orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Slurm, Ray) detects and replaces faulty nodes with minimal downtime.
* **Checkpoints**: Essential to save frequently so training progress isn’t lost.



### **2. Training Instability**

LLM training often experiences instability due to scale, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and noisy data.

#### **Causes of Instability**

* High learning rates → divergence or oscillations.
* Poor weight initialization → vanishing/exploding activations.
* Model scale → larger models exhibit more irregular loss spikes, even late in training.
* Data/model interaction → certain batches interact with specific parameter states to trigger spikes.

#### **Best Practices to Improve Stability**

1. **Batch Size**

   * Use the **largest batch size** the GPU memory allows.
   * Benefits: smoother gradient estimates, better utilization of hardware.

2. **Batch Normalization**

   * Normalize activations within a batch → faster convergence and reduced instability.
   * For Transformers, **LayerNorm** is often used instead.

3. **Learning Rate Scheduling**

   * Start with a warmup (linear increase), then decay:

     * **Step decay**: drop LR at fixed intervals.
     * **Exponential decay**: scale LR down continuously.
     * **Cosine annealing**: smooth periodic decay.

4. **Weight Initialization**

   * Examples: Xavier/He initialization, Gaussian noise, **T-Fixup** (Transformer-specific).
   * Poor initialization → exploding/vanishing gradients.

5. **Pretrained Starting Point**

   * Warm-starting from pretrained weights accelerates convergence and reduces instability.

6. **Regularization**

   * Dropout, weight decay, L1/L2 penalties → prevent overfitting, stabilize training.

7. **Data Augmentation**

   * Introduce variety in training data → prevents overfitting to specific structures.

8. **Hot-Swapping During Training**

   * Switch optimizers (Adam → Adafactor) or activations (ReLU → GELU) mid-training if instability persists.
   * Requires careful monitoring.

9. **Checkpoint Recovery**

   * Restart from a stable earlier checkpoint after spikes/divergence.

10. **Skip Problematic Batches**

    * If spikes correlate with specific data batches → skip them.



### **3. Post-Training Preservation**

* Save the **final model state** (weights, optimizer state, LR schedule, environment configuration, and seeds).
* This ensures **reproducibility** and allows re-training or ablation studies in the future.



### **4. Ablation Studies**

* Systematically remove model components (layers, attention heads, embeddings) to test importance.
* Benefits:

  * Identify redundant parts of the model.
  * Reduce model size and compute cost while retaining most predictive power.



**Summary:**
Training LLMs faces two major hurdles: hardware failures (handled by checkpointing + cluster management) and training instability (handled via LR scheduling, normalization, careful initialization, and monitoring). Maintaining the final environment and running ablation studies ensures reproducibility and efficiency for future work.
